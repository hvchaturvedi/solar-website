          India is among the select nations that enjoy over 300 days of bright
          sunshine annually. This abundant sunlight provides significant
          opportunities to harness solar energy, thereby reducing reliance on
          non-renewable energy sources such as fossil fuels. The most effective
          method to capitalize on this potential is through the installation of
          solar rooftop systems.

        <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed max-w-4xl mx-auto">
          Although solar rooftops have only gained traction in India over the
          past decade, recent years have seen a rapid rise in adoption across
          residential, commercial, industrial, and institutional buildings.

          What is a Solar Rooftop System?
        </h2>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          A solar rooftop system consists of various components that work
          together to generate electricity from sunlight. These systems capture
          solar radiation using photovoltaic (PV) panels and convert it into
          usable electrical energy without producing harmful emissions.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Since solar panels generate Direct Current (DC), an inverter is used
          to convert DC into Alternating Current (AC), which is required to
          operate electrical appliances. Other essential components include
          mounting structures, cables, connectors, protection devices, and
          wiring.
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Solar rooftop systems can power household appliances such as fans,
          lights, refrigerators, televisions, as well as streetlights and
          heavy-duty equipment in commercial and industrial environments.
